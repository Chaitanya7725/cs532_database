Statics vs Dynamic:
Objects, attributes,constraints or entities: Static
Transaction, queries: Dynamic

Generalization: Common out the same attributes/Sharing/Inheritance(Here relationships/how info is being shared(In action box: like takes in the diamond shape object) also gets inherited), For eg., Students are getting generalized i.e. G_students and UG_students
Specialization: Undergrad students are specialized students
Super Entity set is the set which is the common base upon which other entities can be branched out.
